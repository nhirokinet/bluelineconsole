Blue Line Console launches your apps, preset web search engines, and built in calculator via keyboard.

You can launch the desired app quickly with your keyboard everywhere. Just type 2 or 3 characters, and likely you can find the desired app on top of list. You need no configuration to do it (although I prepared some configuration for more comfortable usage).

You can start Blue Line Console by pressing once you set this app to default Assist App of Android. You can also start from notification bar, available everywhere (find this option in configuration screen, opened with config command).
